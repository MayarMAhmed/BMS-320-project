#The plan supposedly goes as follows
  1.To extract the multiple mismatches using MD

  2. JBrowse 1.8.0,to display alignment data, such as from BAM files. 
    This track type shows basepair-level mismatches, insertions, deletions, 
     and skipped regions between aligned reads and the reference, and highlights paired reads in red if their mates are missing.

  3.Investigate the locations and maybe use bamutil
